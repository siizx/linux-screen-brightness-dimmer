Display dimmer for linux.
run xrandr in the terminal to get your screen name.
open 'dimmer.py' with any text editor and replace the display name with yours.
run 'python3 dimmer.py' and set the brightness you wish from 10-100.
(starts from 10 for safety reasons. if you want you can obviously make it go to 0 just by modifying the dimmer.py file. just replace the number 10 with the number you want as minimum brightness).

- tested on linux mint.

- I needed this because sometimes i study or watch tv series while my girlfriend is sleeping beside me, and she is sensible to the screeen light. i tried to dim the screen with os settings and laptop settings but i could go lower a certain point, but it was still too bright. the problem is fixed with this .py file.
